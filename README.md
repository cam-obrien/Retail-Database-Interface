# Retail Databases Interface

## Overview

Our primary objective for this project was to emulate the creation of a web-based interface to be used in a retail setting to track
product quantities, customer accounts, orders, various stores, and other essential business information. The the theoretical business
we created this software for was a lacrosse focused equipment and merchandise store.

## Databse Design
                    
My teammate and I would spend the majority of this project's duration designing the database's tables, creating ERD diagrams and schemas,
and testing the overall design of the database's implementation before working on the interface. This planning can be viewed in the executive
summary attached to the Github repository linked at the bottom of this project description.

## Interface Development

The interface for this application was created with Python and Flask on an Oregon State server over a two week period. The interface includes
pages to view, update, and add table entries to the Products, Orders, Customers, and Stores tables. The various operations of the interface use 
Python to call DML SQL queries to manipulate the database's data. 

## Takeaways

This project was almost entirely based on SQL which I was previously new to. I found the planning process of the database to be initially tedious but came to realize its importance when implementing the database. Looking back on the project I have new interest in pursuing full stack or even backend development. I gained a lot of experience with web development using Python throughout this project which would set me up for success when moving to Django based applications in the future. This was my first experience working in a small development team of two which allowed me to feel in control of the direction of the project and has motivated me to seek similar opportunites in the future.
